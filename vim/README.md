# TheVimConfig

A simple vim config file for personal usage and  
self-learning purporses. Under development...

Is this another vim config file in the world? yes it is!

## Used options
- native:
  - line numbers are setted
  - filetype plugin is enabled
  - autoindentation
  - hlsearch and incsearch enabled
- plugin specific:
  - NERDTreeToggle\<CR\> is mapped to \<C-n\>
  - papaya is setted as the colorscheme (vimcolorscheme plugin used)

Actually, there are more explanation in the vimrc code itself. I'm trying to make
this README self-contained but this will take some time to do, since i'm doing this
on freetime.
